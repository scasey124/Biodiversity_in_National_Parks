# Biodiversity_in_National_Parks
Codecademy Portfolio Porject

One of the various portfolio projects within Codecademy's Data Scientist Career path. The premise is to determine whether or not there are any patterns or themes to the types of species that become endangered. Having little with which to work, I used an old example to provide some questions to be answered throughout the analysis. I used Python 3 to complete this project, in addtion to Jupyter Notebook. Packages utilized include Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
